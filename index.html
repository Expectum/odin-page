            <div class="text">The echidna (ih-KID-na), sometimes called a "spiny anteater", is an egg-laying mammal. These are called monotremes and there are only five in the world: four echidna species, and one platypus species.</div>
        </div>

            <img src="./images/Echidna.jpg" alt="An image of an echidna">
            <div class="text">Echidna breeding season is during July and August, they inhabit scrubland, desert, and montane forests in Australia, Tasmania, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. The nostrils at the tip of the beak help the echidna sniff out its next meal. The rubbery snout is also sensitive to electrical signals from an insect's body. It is strong enough to break open hollow logs and plow up the forest floor in search of insects.</div>

            <div class="text">Like anteaters, the echidna has no teeth. Instead, it uses it's long, sticky tongue to catch and chew its food: ants, termites, or earthworms. Once food is located, the echidna tears into the mound or nest with its large, sharp claws and then uses the 6-inch tongue to lap up the bugs or worms. Hard pads at the base of the tongue and on the roof of the mouth grind the food into a paste for swallowing.</div>

            <img src="./images/Puggle.jpg" alt="An image of a puggle">
            <div class="text">An adult female echidna usually lays a single, leathery egg once a year. She rolls the newly laid egg, about the size of a grape, into a deep pocket, or pouch, on her belly to keep it safe. Ten days later, the baby echidna, called a puggle, hatches. It is smaller than a jelly bean! The mother does not have nipples the way other mammals do. Instead, the little puggle laps up milk that the mother's body secretes from special glands in her pouch.</div>

        <div class="quote"><em>I was never into echidnas until I saw one in person. Holy god of cuteness. It was the most goddang adorable thing I'd ever seen. They move like grumpy puppies and are pleasantly ROUND, something you can't tell by just seeing a pic. They have my vote for the cutest monotreme (sorry platypus).</em></div>
